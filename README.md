This project was created using create-react-app.

####What is it?
We created this app using React as part of an assignment for The Iron Yard. It was our first with the axios API request elements. We focused on the employer as the market for the app, mainly being used in a warehouse-type environment on mobile or tablet. 


####What does it do?
The app allows the user to quickly search through their database and find a product they may be looking for, allowing for clean and easy access to the information needed. On top of the search, we've made the interface to create or add a new product very simple and straight-forward. 


####Additional information
There will be some touch-up and new additions made to the application going forward, but we feel happy with our progress using react and ajax calls with axios after the weekend of using it. Any new ideas or comments are welcome!
